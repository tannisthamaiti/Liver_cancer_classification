## Liver cancer detection and classification system

The methodology to build predictive models on highly skewed data by selecting an example of fraudulent transactions in the financial institutions. This methodology can be applied to any domain to generate predictive system on skewed datasets.

## Imbalanced data set
When faced with imbalanced data sets there is no one stop solution to improve the accuracy of the prediction model. In most cases, synthetic techniques like SMOTE will outperform the conventional oversampling and undersampling methods. In this pattern, we can see the changes in the output with different runs using different techniques and users can play around a bit with the parameters tuning to arrive at optimum results. This is an attempt to demonstrate the methodology to handle skewed data and generate predictive models.
